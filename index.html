				<p>Royal Life Saving Society Australia’s mission is to make Australia a nation free from drowning, leading the Australian Water Safety Council’s goal to reduce drownings by 50% by 2020. We are working towards this goal by setting up programs and delivering curriculums that teach Australian’s like yourself how to be smart and confident in the water. We want all Australians to be able to safely enjoy our beautiful waters! To find out more about the work we do, head over to our main <a href="https://www.royallifesaving.com.au/"> website</a>.</p>

        <p>Drownings are most represented by adults aged 25-34, 35-44, and 65-74. Males also make up 80% of drownings. RLSSA offers programs for adults as well, swimming lessons are for all.</p>

			<div class="stat2">
				<h1>stat2</h1>
        <p>The most common locations for drownings are outdoor locations such as beaches and rivers - most coming from recreational activity. It is important that we all know the dangers of these environments and activities in order to stay safe.</p>

        <p>From Australia’s diverse communities, individuals of culturally diverse backgrounds, indigenous background, and low income communities are particular at-risk groups when it comes to drowning. Royal Life Saving organises programs that are dedicated to bringing water safety programs to these groups. Some of these may also be in your community as well.</p>
