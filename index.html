        <p>The most common locations for drownings are outdoor locations such as beaches and rivers - most coming from recreational activity. It is important that we all know the dangers of these environments and activities in order to stay safe.</p>

        <p>From Australia’s diverse communities, individuals of culturally diverse backgrounds, indigenous background, and low income communities are particular at-risk groups when it comes to drowning. Royal Life Saving organises programs that are dedicated to bringing water safety programs to these groups. Some of these may also be in your community as well.</p>
