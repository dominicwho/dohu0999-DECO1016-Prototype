      <p>Each of Australia’s aquatic environments pose unique conditions that make them so special - but could also become dangerous if the risks aren’t acknowledged. Here are some quick guidelines to familiarise yourself with the conditions for each of these environments.</p>

        <h2>Swimming Pools</h2>
        <p>Whether in a backyard or one of the many public pools across Australia, swimming pools are a great place to chill out with friends or to stay fit and healthy. Here are a few things to keep in mind before diving in.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Public pools all have rules that must be followed by patrons, and are enforced by on duty lifeguards. While many are shared such as no diving in the shallow end and no running on the pool deck, be sure to check out your venues rules as each have their own layout and way of functioning.</li>
          <li>Home swimming pools can be just as dangerous as public pools. Royal Life Saving has a Home Pool Safety Checklist of highly recommended guidelines to follow to ensure the safety users. You can find more about Royal Life Saving’s home pool safety recommendations here.</li>
          <li>Swimming pools are the best place to develop your water competency skills if you haven’t already. With dedicated programs, trained instructors, and a safe controlled environment there is no better place to learn to swim. Check out the "Find" page to find a suitable program near you.</li>

        <h2>Beaches</h2>
        <p>Probably Australia’s most iconic natural feature, yet one of its deadliest. Beaches make for a great day, especially on a hot summer’s day where a dip in the cool ocean is all you need. Here are some things to remember for a day out on our sandy shores.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lifeguards are stationed on patrol at many beaches and can easily be identified by their bright yellow and red uniforms. They’re always happy to help you out.</li>
          <li>Patrolled beaches will have a set of red and yellow flags in which you should swim in between. These are areas that are outlined to be safe. Don’t venture out too far if you are not a strong swimmer.</li>
          <li>Rips are strong currents that can quickly take you out to sea. They can be recognised by their dark colour in comparison to the safe areas between the flags. If you ever find yourself caught out in a rip, stay calm and go with the rip. Lifeguards will come to you or the current will bring you back to shore.</li>
          <li>To find out more, check out our page on beach safety, where we have a fact sheet. Also check out our friends at Surf Life Saving Australia for more information.</li>

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>There are many ways to have fun in and around the water. From waterparks to boating, there’s a whole lot you can do, but each kind creates a new environment with behaviours that you need to pay attention to. Here are some general considerations when taking part in any aquatic activity.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All activities should be conducted in a safe environment. Participants should be made clear  of the risks and appropriate mitigations of them. All risks should have been assessed.</li>
          <li>Activities such as boating and fishing may require licensing from a governing body.</li>
          <li>Be wary of the time of day in relation to tides.</li>
